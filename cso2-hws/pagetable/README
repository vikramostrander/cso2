Pagetable Documentation

Customizing Pagetable
    All customizing is done through config.h
    LEVELS: number of levels in the pagetable. Can take values {1 ... 6}.
    POBITS: number of bits for the page offset. Can take values {4 ... 18}.
    To change a value, change the value to the right of the variable.

Example Use Case:
    An educational tool to aid in the understanding of address translation
    in pagetables, and how pagetables with different numbers of levels and 
    different numbers of bits used for the page offset work.

Bugs/Limitations:
    Allocated memory is not freed in current implementation.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
    None.

De-Allocation Issues:
    The current deallocate implementation needs to be called once for all
    pagetables: 

        page_deallocate(ptbr);
    
    This implementation of page deallocate, however, is slow, especially
    for multi-level page tables. A better implementation would be keeping
    track of each call to page_allocate, and freeing only what is needed,
    but this could require storing many addresses which would require
    allocating more memory.
